Project description
-------------------
The idea of this project is to provide a simple yet powerful API for image 
processing using only JavaScript. The API is very focused in usability and 
code readability, since it also serves for educational purposes.

The project was created for student, so, it's only tested on Google Chrome. 
New ES6 features, such as Promises, are also used.

About the samples
-----------------
Several samples are provided in the sample folder. The samples use inline 
scripts and as few css as possible, for simplicity, since it's easier to study 
just one file than several.

All sample images where kindly donated by the Gilson Cavalcanti Filho, a great 
photographer and a personal friend, and may be used for API demonstration and 
educational purposes. Some images are deliberately in poor quality, in order to 
demonstrate correction filters.
